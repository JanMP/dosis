#Dosis

a little charting app for personal use

deployed at https://secret-meadow-39403.herokuapp.com

I also use this project to get some practice on testing.

this will start meteor in test mode (you can do that in a separate bash shell while running meteor normally)

```
meteor test --driver-package practicalmeteor:mocha --port 3100
```
